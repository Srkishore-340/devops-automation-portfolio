# devops-automation-portfolio
This repository contains production-style Linux automation projects designed to simulate real-world DevOps and SRE responsibilities.
The projects focus on reliability, error handling, logging, performance, and operational readiness.


## Skills Demonstrated

- Linux Shell Scripting (Bash)
- Input Validation & Error Handling
- Log Parsing & Analysis
- Cron Job Automation
- Backup & Recovery Automation
- Process Monitoring
- Docker-based Script Execution
- CI/CD Integration (GitHub Actions)
- Production-Grade Script Structuring


## Repository Structure

01-linux-log-analyzer/         → Log parsing and analysis 

## Engineering Principles Applied

- Strict input validation
- Distinct exit codes for failure scenarios
- Proper stderr usage
- Defensive scripting practices
- Single-responsibility script design
- Production-ready output formatting
- Edge case handling (empty files, missing logs, permission errors)


## Planned Enhancements

- Log monitoring with alerting
- System health check automation
- Infrastructure automation integration
- Performance-optimized parsing using awk
